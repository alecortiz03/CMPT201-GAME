CAMPFIRE ESCAPE

- In the heart of a whispering forest, shrouded in the cloak of night, lies an adventure that will chill you to the bone - Campfire Escape. 
Once a serene place for storytelling and laughter, the campgrounds have turned eerily silent, with a spine-tingling mystery waiting to be uncovered. 
You, the protagonist, find yourself trapped in this haunting landscape, with nothing but the moon's glow and the distant echo of forgotten tales to 
guide you.



- The game unfolds through four distinct sections of the spooky campsite, each with its own quizzes and keys that you must discover to unravel the 
path to freedom. These sections, known as The Forest, The House, The Chimney House, and The Tents, are filled with puzzles 
that tease the mind.
